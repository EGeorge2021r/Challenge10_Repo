Crypto Clustering - Combining financial Python programming with unsupervised learning

# User Story
Role: Advisor FinTech Consulting Firm

Goal: The project goal is to combine financial Python programming with unsupervised learning to create a Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods and also plot the results and visually show the performance to the board

Reason: As competitors are fiece, a novel approach is being proposed to assemble investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies. Instead of basing the proposal on only returns and volatility, other factors that might impact the crypto marketâ€”leading to better performance of the portfolio are included. Also included in this package is the creation of a prototype for submitting crypto portfolio proposal to the company board of directors.
