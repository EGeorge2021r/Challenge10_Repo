Crypto Clustering - Combining financial Python programming with unsupervised learning

# User Story
Role: Advisor FinTech Consulting Firm

Goal: The project goal is combine financial Python programming with unsupervised learning create a Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods and also plot the results so that you can visually show the performance to the board

Reason: As competitors are fiece, I am proposing a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies. Instead of basing my proposal on only returns and volatility, I am including other factors that might impact the crypto marketâ€”leading to better performance for my portfolio. I am also creating a prototype for submitting my crypto portfolio proposal to the company board of directors.

# Analysis and Visualisation
The following key requirements were achieved in the project:
Import the Data (provided in the starter code)
Prepare the Data (provided in the starter code)
Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Data
Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data
Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis 
Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data 
Visualize and Compare the Results by creating a composite plot using hvPlot and the plus (+) operator
